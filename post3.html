              <h1>The Website being tested.</h1>
              The site I am analyzing is <a href="https://www.jinx.com/"><b>Jinx.com</b></a>
              <a href="#">
                  <img class="img-fluid" src="img/jinx.jpg" alt="Jinx">
                </a>
              <h1>What is the purpose of this site</h1>
                <p>This is a clothing website geared towards video game players, geeks, and the sort. They sell clothing and acessories featuring
                    various video game properies in addition to their own Jinx branded merchandice. The website has gone though a design change since I've last been here
                    so I figured it would be a good oppurtunity to see if someone who has never been to this site can navigate it.
                </p>
                <h1>Testing</h1>
                <p>The purpose of this test is to see how new users will be able to navigate the website</p>
                <p>I went for those who have never been to the website before for the testers.
                </p>
                <p>The testers consisted of a 22 year old woman, 35 year old man, and a 23 year old man. Each with varying degress of  web experience.</p>
              <h1>Tasks</h1>
                <p>For the assessment I followed a simple script that was presented to each of them.</p>

              <p>Hello, thank you for taking time with me to conduct a usability test for this website
                    As a reminder this will be recorded. Are you okay with that? </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                    <li>To start off, just look around the home page. What do you see? </li>
                    <li>Who do you think this web site is geared towards? </li>
                    <li>Do I understand what this site is? </li>
                    <li>That icon on the top right what is that? </li>
                    <li>Find where I can buy socks. </li>
                    <li>Can I find where they are based out of? </li>
                    <li>Find information on their return policy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With that I think we are done. Thanks for your time.</p>
                    

              <h1>Results</h1>
                <p>For one 22 year old woman I was able to record their interaction with the website. Which can be seen below</p>
                <iframe width="560px" height="320px" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://seattleu.instructuremedia.com/embed/7e3e0f09-e5f9-415c-b12c-1ee27a029536" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                <p>Like the tester in the video the other two participants had some sort of idea what the website was and who it was geared to, though they
                didn't see it was geared more towards the gamer type until after they looked around the website some more. They all generally found it easy to navigate, with the navigation bar located clearly on the left.
                 Normally most sites have information such as contacts and other information
                at the bottom of the page, this one does too, but only after you click the "Help & information" button at the bottom left on the page. It took two of them a few moments to realize that.
            
                <p>One did bring up that their 2019 spring collection banner takes up the majority of the page, forcing everything else towards the bottom out of view.
                I'm assuming this is temporary and will be out of the way in the future. It was also pointed out that it was odd that socks was listed under "Acessories" rather than "Clothes".
            When tasked to locate socks to buy users initally went to look under clothing only to find that they were not there.</p> 
            </p>

                
              <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>Overall the users found the site simple to navigate, although there was some odd things on the page, like the pants icon on the right. 
                    One thing I can suggest is not having the current promotion hog all the space on the main page, and also have contact information appear automaticly at the bottom of the page.
                    I would like to do additional testing to see how users are able to go about setting up accounts and purchasing products.
                </p>
